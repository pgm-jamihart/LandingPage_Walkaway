# About us

Welcome to Walkaway, your number one source for all kinds of walking routes. We're dedicated to giving you the very best.

Founded in 2021 by Jamie-Lee Hart, Walkaway has come a long way from its beginnings. When Jamie-Lee Hart first started out, his passion for walking drove him to creating a walking app, and gave him the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming app. We now serve customers all over the world, and are thrilled to be a part of your hiking adventures.

We hope you enjoy our app as much as we enjoy offering it to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,

Jamie-Lee Hart, CEO & Founder
