# Camera

**Capture your experiences, take pictures with app and share them with your friends**

If you come across a geocaching or beautiful location, you can turn on the camera function and save the experience by taking a photo of it. The photo will then be saved as a photo on your smartphone and you can share it with whoever you want.
