    <h1>Walking Benefits - Weight Loss, Lower Stress And Other Ways This Simple Activity Can Help You</h1>
<p><em>Walking benefits: Research published by U.K. based scientists at the Heriot-Watt University, suggests that taking a walk in green spaces tends to create a calming state of mind.</em></p>

<p>Besides improving an individual's physical parameters, walking plays a crucial role in maintaining and improving his/her mental health. We live in a world, which is dominated by the daily struggles of a fast-paced life. Modern-day individuals not only feel pressure from the professional front but are also bogged down by numerous personal issues. While tackling and dealing with all these day-to-day troubles, one may often find oneself suffering from the most common devil - stress. Besides impacting a person's mental peace, self-perception, and overall personality, it has adverse effects on the body as well.

<p>The map on the Geocaching app or website shows where the waterproof containers are located, and as you click on any geocache on the map, you can follow the directions of your GPS to reach it. Most of the time, you find a tiny notebook inside the geocache with the names or nicknames of people who have found the geocache before you, along with any other items they may have left inside the container. You never know what the cache owner or previous visitors may have left for you to enjoy! Some containers include instructions to find other geocaches in the city, so why not follow them and continue your treasure hunt, discovering Brno and spending an engaging time in the city. The first caches you find will most likely be as small as a pickle jar. As you keep on playing and discovering more and more geocaches, you may level up your game and look for bigger containers, which can be as big as a 20-litre bucket.</p>

<p>Geocaching dates back to the year 2000, born from an attempt to test the effectiveness of then-emerging GPS technology. Computer consultant Dave Ulmer wanted to test the accuracy of GPS by hiding a navigational target in the woods. He named it the ‘Great American GPS Stash Hunt’ and shared it in an internet GPS users’ group. His idea was simple: to hide a container out in the woods and note the coordinates with a GPS unit. The searcher would then have to find the container with only the use of their GPS. The initiative later developed into a game and has been transformed into a treasure hunt played around the world. You can find out more about the rules, guidelines, history, and details of the game <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/guide/default.aspx">here</a></p>
